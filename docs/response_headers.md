# Response Headers

1. `vary`: This header informs the client or any intermediary caches about which request headers should be used to determine whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server. In your case, it varies on 'Origin' and 'Accept-Encoding', which helps in serving the correct content for requests from different origins and with different encoding capabilities.
2. `access-control-allow-credentials`: This CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) header allows credentials such as cookies, authorization headers, or TLS client certificates to be sent with requests to the domain. 'true' enables these credentials.
3. `content-security-policy`: This is a crucial security header used to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. It restricts resources (scripts, images, etc.) to only be loaded from specific allowed origins. Your policy restricts various types of resources to load only from the same origin, with some allowances for fonts, styles, and images.
4. `cross-origin-opener-policy` and `cross-origin-resource-policy`: These headers prevent cross-origin information leakage and protect against Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB) and Spectre-like attacks by isolating your origin from other origins.
5. `origin-agent-cluster`: By setting this to '?1', you're opting into a newer model where each origin gets its own separate agent cluster, potentially improving security and performance by isolating your site from others in the same process.
6. `referrer-policy`: This header controls the amount of referrer information sent with requests. 'no-referrer' means no referrer information will be included with requests, enhancing privacy.
7. `strict-transport-security`: HSTS enforces secure (HTTPS) connections to the server. 'max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains' ensures that for the next 180 days, all subdomains will only be accessed securely using HTTPS.
8. `x-content-type-options`: Setting this to 'nosniff' prevents the browser from attempting to mime-sniff the content type of a resource, which can help prevent security risks from incorrect content handling.
9. `x-dns-prefetch-control`: By setting to 'off', this header prevents the browser from performing DNS prefetching, which can sometimes leak information about which hyperlinks are likely to be followed.
10. `x-download-options`: 'noopen' prevents Internet Explorer from executing downloads in your site’s context, mitigating execution risks in the context of the site.
11. `x-frame-options`: 'SAMEORIGIN' only allows your site to be framed by pages of the same origin, helping to prevent clickjacking attacks.
12. `x-permitted-cross-domain-policies`: 'none' prevents the XML flash objects from allowing cross-domain data loading, reducing potential data leakage.
13. `x-xss-protection`: Deprecated and set to '0' because modern browsers have built-in protection against XSS and this header is no longer effective.
14. `surrogate-control` and `cache-control`: Both are used to control cache rules. 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate' and 'no-store' ensure that responses aren’t stored in cache, which is crucial for dynamic content or sensitive information.
15. `expires`: Set to '0' to prevent caching of the response.
16. `ratelimit-policy and ratelimit`: These headers are used to control the rate of requests a user can make to the server, preventing abuse.
17. `set-cookie`: Configures cookies with security flags like HttpOnly and SameSite, which are good practices for protecting session cookies.
18. `content-type` and `content-length`: Specify the media type and the length of the response body in bytes, respectively.
19. `etag`: Used to help with cache validation, allowing optimized conditional requests.
